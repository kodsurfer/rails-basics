### Ruby on Rails Basics
1. **Ruby**:
   - Basic syntax and semantics
   - Control structures (if, else, case, loops)
   - Methods and blocks
   - Classes and objects
   - Modules and mixins
   - Standard libraries and gems

2. **Ruby on Rails**:
   - Introduction to Rails framework
   - Rails project structure
   - Routing (`config/routes.rb`)
   - Controllers (`app/controllers`)
   - Views (`app/views`)
   - Models (`app/models`)
   - Helpers (`app/helpers`)
   - Assets (`app/assets`)
   - Configuration (`config/`)
   - Environment configuration (`config/environments/`)
   - Initializers (`config/initializers/`)

3. **MVC (Model-View-Controller)**:
   - Understanding the MVC pattern
   - Role of Models, Views, and Controllers
   - Data flow in MVC

4. **Object-Oriented-Design in Ruby**:
   - Encapsulation
   - Inheritance
   - Polymorphism
   - Abstraction
   - Design patterns (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Decorator)

5. **SQL**:
   - Basic SQL queries (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
   - Joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN)
   - Aggregation functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN)
   - Subqueries
   - Indexes and performance optimization

6. **Active Record Basics**:
   - ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)
   - Active Record models
   - CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
   - Validations
   - Associations (has_many, belongs_to, has_one, has_and_belongs_to_many)
   - Callbacks (before_save, after_create, etc.)
   - Migrations
   - Query interface (where, order, limit, etc.)

### Additional Topics

7. **Views and Templates**:
   - ERB (Embedded Ruby)
   - Layouts and partials
   - Rendering JSON and XML
   - Forms and form helpers
   - Asset pipeline

8. **Controllers**:
   - RESTful routes and actions
   - Strong parameters
   - Filters (before_action, after_action)
   - Flash messages
   - Redirects and rendering

9. **Testing**:
   - Unit testing with RSpec or Minitest
   - Integration testing
   - System testing
   - Test fixtures and factories

10. **Security**:
    - Authentication (Devise, Authlogic)
    - Authorization (CanCanCan, Pundit)
    - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) prevention
    - SQL Injection prevention
    - CSRF protection

11. **Deployment**:
    - Capistrano for deployment
    - Heroku deployment
    - AWS deployment
    - Environment variables and secrets management

12. **Gems and Plugins**:
    - Popular gems (e.g., Devise for authentication, CarrierWave for file uploads, Sidekiq for background jobs)
    - Creating and using custom gems

13. **Background Jobs**:
    - Sidekiq, Resque, or Delayed Job
    - Queues and workers
    - Scheduling jobs

14. **APIs**:
    - Building RESTful APIs
    - Serializers (e.g., ActiveModel::Serializers)
    - Versioning APIs
    - Handling API authentication and authorization

15. **Caching**:
    - Page caching
    - Action caching
    - Fragment caching
    - Russian doll caching

16. **Internationalization (I18n)**:
    - Translations
    - Locale files
    - Date and time localization

17. **Performance Optimization**:
    - Database indexing
    - Eager loading (includes, joins)
    - Caching strategies
    - Profiling and benchmarking

18. **Version Control**:
    - Git basics
    - Branching and merging
    - Pull requests and code reviews

19. **Collaboration and Best Practices**:
    - Code style and linting
    - Documentation
    - Continuous integration (CI)
    - Code reviews

20. **Advanced Topics**:
    - Service objects
    - Decorators and presenters
    - Form objects
    - Query objects
    - Background workers
    - WebSockets and ActionCable

By covering these topics, you'll gain a solid foundation in Ruby on Rails and be well-equipped to build and maintain robust web applications. Happy coding!
